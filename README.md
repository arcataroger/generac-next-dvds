# David's DVDs

## Notes

- Subtitle was not provided
- Used DVD png as favicon and title icon instead of emoji, to prevent unicode issues and device differences
- Used simple JSON file instead of DB
- Used React-Bootstrap for basic layout
- Instead of "select multiple to add to cart" paradigm, gave each movie its own Add to Cart button for better UX (don't deviate from established ecommerce norms)
- Did not implement API, but can if desired
- A lot of UX work still remaining
- Uses Next.js instead of Replit's environment
- Uses The Movie Database's free API as a demo (key not secretized)
